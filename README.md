Implementation of a basic shell terminal in C

fork() Concept: http://www.cs.iit.edu/~cs561/cs450/fork/fork.html

## A project from 42 School Silicon Valleys' curriculum (out-dated)

<p>The primary focus for this project was to code a terminal shell that mimics the basic functions of the Bash cli.</p>

#### using only the following functions:

* malloc, free, access, open, close, read, write

* opendir, readdir, closedir, getcwd, chdir, stat

* lstat, fstat, fork, execve, wait, waitpid, wait3

* wait4, signal, kill, exit

#### And, functions created for our implementation of standard C function in Libft
